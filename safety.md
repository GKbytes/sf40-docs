# Safety instructions

## Overview

The SF40 is a laser rangefinder that emits ionizing laser radiation. The level of the laser emission is Class 1M which indicates that
the laser beam is safe to look at with the unaided eye but must not be viewed using binoculars or other optical devices at a distance
of less than 15 meters. Notwithstanding the safety rating, avoid looking into the beam and switch the unit off when working in the
area.

!> CAUTION -- The use of optical instruments with this product will increase eye hazard.

The SF40 should not be disassembled or modified in any way. The laser eye safety rating depends on the mechanical integrity of the
optics and electronics so if these are damaged do not continue using the SF40. There are no user serviceable parts and maintenance
or repair must only be carried out by the manufacturer or a qualified service agent.

No regular maintenance is required for the SF40 but if the lenses start to collect dust then they may be wiped with suitable lens
cleaning materials. Make sure that the SF40 is switched OFF before looking into the lenses.

The SF40 should be mounted using the four holes provided in the circuit board. Do not hold or clamp the lens tubes as this may cause
damage and adversely affect the laser safety rating.
